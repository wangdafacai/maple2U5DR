# maple2U5DR
maple2U5DR is an R package for fitting statistical models on demographic data to produce projections of death rates
# Prerequisites
The code uses the INLA algorithm to fit most of the models, implemented in the R package INLA. More information on how to download and install it can be found on the INLA website. Note that you may need to install package sp first by running install.packages("sp").
# Note 
I want to use the maple package (https://github.com/vkontis/maple) to forecast future under 5 death rate, but the maple package is to design for forecast future life expectancy, it is not suitable to forecast under 5 death rate. So I make some changes of maple package, making it suitable to forecast future under 5 death rate.
# How to use
This package works as same as maple package (https://github.com/vkontis/maple).
